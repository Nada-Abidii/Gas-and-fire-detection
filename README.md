# Embedded System for Hazardous Gas and Fire Detection

## Overview
This project aims to enhance safety in industrial and domestic environments by developing an embedded system for detecting hazardous gas leaks and fire. The system is built using an STM32 microcontroller, a gas sensor (MQ9), and a flame detector. It provides real-time alerts to warn users about potential dangers, ensuring a rapid response to mitigate risks.

## Features
- *Real-time Gas and Fire Detection*: Uses MQ9 gas sensor for detecting Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Methane (CH4) and a flame sensor for fire detection.
- *STM32-Based Embedded System*: Efficiently processes sensor data and triggers alerts.
- *Visual and Audible Alerts*: LEDs and a buzzer provide immediate warnings.
- *LCD Display*: Displays system status and detected hazards.
- *Prototyping and Testing*: Simulated in Proteus and tested in real-life scenarios.

## System Components
- *STM32 Nucleo-F401RE*: Microcontroller used for data processing and control.
- *MQ9 Gas Sensor*: Detects hazardous gases (CO and CH4).
